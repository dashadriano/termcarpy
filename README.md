<p align="center">A py-written car game for CLIs.</p>

## üê£ Termcarpy Origins:

Rehauling/salvaging an old project of mine. One of the first python programs I've built out of boredom.

## üìù Termcarpy Explanation:
`termcarpy` is basically a logic-powered car game, unfortunately the UI/UX design is lacking as I was merely testing out my python logic during the creation of this. Trying to build this to be a small CLI game now. May or may not deploy it beyond the CLI, we'll see as I progress.

## ‚ö† Termcarpy Background:
Last version was a bit of a mess, not a lot of methods, as it was mainly built as it went. 
(Totally new to Python during this time period) 



Made a few changes like creating `conditions.py` for the car logic, after logging driver's name.

## ‚ûï Moving Forward
Still relatively new at this point, just trying out concepts I'll be learning like importing, class creation, and so on.

New updates will most likely be stuff I will learn about Python in general that can contribute to this little project of mine.

Totally open to constructive comments/suggestions! Still learning, and will most likely always be.
